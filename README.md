# SRdatawrangling
This repository contains my project submission for Data Wrangling project on Sliderule's introduction to Data Science Workshop. 
Here is the problem statement for this project

Description: One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
In this project, you will analyze this dataset collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description of the data is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
